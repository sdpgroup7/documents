\section{Group Dynamics}

\subsection{Team Meetings}

At the beginning of the project the team agreed to meet once a week. As the
project progressed\footnote{Around the second milestone} it became clear that
the amount of work getting done and the need for discussions and decisions that
could not be done within the confines of an email conversion.

\subsection{Issue resolution}

When there was an issue which could not be resolved within a team meeting or
there was significant disagreement on a subject a sub team would be created.
The sub team would consist of three or four people from various
teams\footnote{Control, Vision, Strategy, Simulator, and Construction} who the
outcome of the decision would have an effect on.

For example, when it was realised that there was problems with control code,
people representing control, control interface, and simulator were present. It
would not have been useful for the entire team to discuss the subject. The
people represented both had an understanding of the problems with the current
control system and their work would be directly affected by the changes that
would come out of that meeting.

The decisions taken by the meeting would be relayed to the rest of the team and
anything that needed done assigned to the appropriate parties.

\subsection{Simulator}

The largest failing with regard to teamwork and team communication was the
assignment of only one person initially to the development of the simulator. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item The team member was not present for some of the team meetings. Progress
  reports from email suggested that development was going well
\end{itemize}
