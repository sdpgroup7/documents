\section{Strategy}

\subsection{Control Interface}

With the method of planning being set as A-star we needed some method to
convert the plan given by the strategy systems into commands the robot could
preform. Our objective for this subsystem was to find a simple algorithm that
would create a smooth robotic motion which could respond without disruption to
changes in strategy's plan.

Point to point navigation, the robot turning and moving to each point on the
A-star plan, was dismissed early on. It would not provide us with the smooth
motion we wanted as it would have stopped at each point on the path whenever it
needed to make a significant turn.

We reasoned that the best way to solve the problem of the stop start motion of
the point to point navigation was to apply smoothing to the path given by
A star. A variation of A star called Theta star provided this by selecting
a lookahead distance which allowed some points on the path to be missed out
thus creating a smoother path.

The Pure Pursuit algorithm was found to satisfy our needs. It is used
frequently in autonomous vehicles with non holomonic
movement for path tracking\cite{agvpp}\cite{coulterpp}. In our case we are
using it to track the path given to us by A star.

As the robot is constantly moving in some sort of arc under pure pursuit this
eliminates the problems caused by point to point navigation. The motion is
smooth and uninterrupted. Pure pursuit also only considers a limited distance
in front of it the plan can be changed as the situation on the pitch changed.
