\section{Vision}

\subsection{Code Reuse}

We started off by taking group 3's from last year code.  We chose this group's code because it was written in Java which we were all familiar with allowing us to get to work straight away.  Their control G.U.I. was also very impressive, being clean and easy to use.

We also used the barrel distortion correction code from group 5.  Most groups who had barrel distortion correction were using a variant of openCV and so had functions that we couldn't use.  Group 3 had attempted to correct the barrel distortion but had been unsuccessful which is why we used group 5.  It was very effective working straight out of the box.

\subsection{In the Beginning}

After deciding on which code we were going to use we started to realise how unwieldy it was.  Most of the work was being done in an undocumented 700ish line method.  So first thing for us to do was to work out what was going and try and do our best to refactor it to make it more understandable.
