%introduction to the flow diagram of subsystems and why (maybe) it breaks down 
%this way. - Chris
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%Can someone do me a decent flow diagram, as our current one is shit!

Research into previous year's code revealed a common structural layout Fig X. 
Nearly all previous year groups broke their project into obvious subsections; 
A shared object which contained environmental data (A WorldState), a Vision 
system that fed and updated the shared object, a Strategy system that was 
considered the 'Artificial Intelligence' (although mostly they consisted of 
Subsumption Architectures) taking its cues from the shared object, and a Control 
System that interfaces between the Computer System and the Robot: between the 
Strategy and the Robot. These independant subsystems in some cases can be broken 
down futher and will be discussed subsequently.
