\section{Introduction}

In the beginning the entire team met and decided on a common programming language,
a version control system, a team leader, and what sub-systems people
wanted to work on\footnote{Full details in appendix~\ref{apx:roles}}. Java was
chosen as the language and Git was chosen as the version control system
members had experience with it.

Research into previous year's code revealed a common structural layout CITE THE
%TODO
FIGURE.  Nearly all previous year groups broke their project into subsections;
A shared object which contained environmental data (A WorldState), a vision
system that fed and updated the shared object, a strategy system that was
considered the 'artificial intelligence', and a control system that interfaces between the
computer and the robot.
