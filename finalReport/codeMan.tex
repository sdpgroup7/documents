\subsubsection{Unit testing}
We used JUnit as our testing framework. The tests were usually written either for examining behaviour of small pieces of the last year's code or for assisting in producing our own code. In addition to these unit tests, the Vision testing tool was, after its manual configuration, run by JUnit. This allowed a great deal of automation with Jenkins and we would be notified not only if the build process failed, but also if anything in our regression test suit failed.
