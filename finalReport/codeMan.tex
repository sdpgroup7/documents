\section{Code Management \& Integration}

%do we use subsection or subsubsection under sections in this model?
\subsubsection{Unit testing}
We used JUnit as our testing framework. The tests were usually written either for examining behaviour of small pieces of the last year's code or for assisting in producing our own code. In addition to these unit tests, the Vision testing tool was, after its manual configuration, run by JUnit. This allowed a great deal of automation with Jenkins and we would be notified not only if the build process failed, but also if anything in our regression test suit failed.

\subsection{Javadoc}
Towards the end of the project we started writing javadoc comments for the whole system.  Ideally we should have done this from the start as it would have made it easier for all us to drop in out of sections we weren't familiar with.  Ultimately it will be more useful for any team that decides to use some of our code next year. 

To make the Javadoc more conveniant to use we decided to host it online using github's free hosting.  David wrote a build file to autogenerate all the Javadoc and commit it to the correct branch of the repo and then push it to our repository, allowing us online access.  This was not trivial and David could not find anybody who had done something similar and published how they did it so he has put a how to found here CITE URL TO DAVIDS BLOG
