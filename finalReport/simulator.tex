\section{Simulator}

During one of the first meetings, it was decided that a simulator may prove useful when testing strategies. One student was assigned the task of creating the whole simulator, which later proved to be a mistake, as the simulator turned out to be a more complex problem than it was initially thought. Communication problems and health issues troubled the successful delivery of a working simulator. An unfortunate choice of language for the backend meant that nobody could take over the development without explanation of simulator's internals.

In the end, the development of the simulator was stopped and the simulator remains incomplete. The simulator lacks a proper physics model for ball simulation, only robot behaviour is simulated.
